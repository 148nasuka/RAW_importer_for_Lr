    <string name="About">About this app</string>
    <string name="About_sent1">This app is an app that converts RAW files from a single-lens reflex camera into files that can be edited with the mobile app version of Lightroom.\n\n\n
        About data handling\n
        This application reads the files in your device, but only the media files (images) stored in your device.
        The read file only changes its name, so it does not change the contents of the file.
        In addition, this app does not make any changes to the files managed by Lightroom, and modifies the files before they are loaded into Lightroom.\n\n\n
        About Privacy\n
        Since this application processes completely offline, it does not send the user\'s personal data to the outside at all, but device data such as the device name is sent to Google for the purpose of improving the service.\n\n\n
        If you have any comments or feedback, please contact Play Store or Email Address.\n
